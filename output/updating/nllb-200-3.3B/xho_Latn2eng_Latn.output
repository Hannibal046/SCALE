This not only proves that other dinosaurs had wings, a widely held theory, but provides clues that mere bones cannot, such as color, shape, and triangular symmetry.
Scientists say the animal was brown with chestnut on top and a brownish or carotenoid underside.
The findings provide insight into the evolution of the bird's wings.
Because dinosaur feathers are not curved, called rachis, but have some features of feathers  barbs and barbules  researchers have speculated that the rachis is more rounded than the other feathers.
The shape of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that, although this is a tiny dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult feathers rather than a chick on the ground.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effects the team was looking for might have been caused by the energy flux between the dark galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.

The document, allegedly, refers to the border dispute, which the Palestinians claimed was a reference to the pre-1967 Mideast war borders.
Other topics discussed include the future status of holy Jerusalem in both tribes and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the plain for ten years after the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control case would be closely monitored by the rangers, as the case was monitored and its effectiveness tested.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers were recruited, under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooter Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the first four shooters targeted received full safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth year of the CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended before the CEP's demise a series of measures to bring the country closer to the vote.
The movement was Martelly's response to the growing revolutionary movement that had begun in October.
Other protests that turned violent were against the 2011 elections, which were scheduled to be held later that year.
Sixty cases of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said that they were aware of 27 hazards associated with weapons.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 incidents of extreme heat, an event the company said was "not significant".
After Apple withdrew the report, the department took a deep breath and said "this is a disaster".
The earthquake struck the Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the tribe.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says that there are no tsunami warning signs.
A former Filipino policeman finally takes Hong Kong travelers as his prisoners by attacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have died so far.
Six arrests, including children and adults, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady as she went to the laundry.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to work as a doctor.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research suggested that the use of hormones could help accelerate the development of fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" of aircraft recorders from the airport on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died in the night of two months. She was beautiful alone as she was. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels remarked that "Luna was as dumb as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Conservative Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should be made a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those voting shared this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the case of extreme tests, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believe Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to have swum in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints her fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary pain medication as he was banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest number known to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Ice and vapor in space may have been the source of water supply to the earth, aided by natural processes that can produce proteins to sustain life.
Scientists are trying to understand how the continents formed, especially the Earth, because the lines have been in contact with the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to gossip as political motivation and washing.
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a program the FAA says could allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce emissions.
It uses solar technology unlike the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to precisely target the aircraft and provide their pilots with accurate information.
No additional vehicles are being laid down and the subway will not stop at Wembley, and parking lots and car-parking and boarding areas are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of public transportation have led to fears that the match will not have a supportive crowd.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science has identified a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it is believed that this process takes longer, due to interbreeding between the Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migrant cactus.
Gold can be formed into any number of shapes, and it can be formed into many different microscopic shapes.
It can be pulled from a thin wire, which can be twisted and made visible. It can be mounted with a hammer or rolled into sheets.
It could be made so thin, and it could be glued to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "light manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice varies depending on whether it is acidic or bitter (alkaline).
The pH value is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (H to pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Stir the dry powder together and then, with clean hands, knead it into a paste.
Moisture on your hands is absorbed by the outer skin, which feels unusual and becomes flaky.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, covered with grass in a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan city of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman era, the bathroom was sometimes part of a public bath where men and women shared a common bath.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
An aerial satellite receives a call and then it is displayed later, much sooner.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere interferes with our light and vision.
It carries a rocket that is over 100 feet long to hang a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has revolved the world in many ways. The wheel's greatest contribution to our lives has been to provide us with a simple and fast means of transport.
It has provided us with a train, a car, and other means of transportation.
Below them are the intermediate cats that prey on intermediate prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging cats) that eat most of the victims of insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their pursuit of success is a rare feat, each cat having its own unique job that makes them competitive with others.
Lions are the largest of the big cats that live in large groups called libu.
A pride is made up of one to three adult lions, and the females and their offspring number up to thirty.
The women are often related, forming a large family of sisters and their daughters.
Lion families are similar to wild dog families or to dogs, animals that are as healthy as lions (but not other wildcats), and are a great threat to their owners.
A good runner, the tiger can climb (though not very well), run, jump, and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the cheetah. Only four of the cats are able to roar.
The great leopard's roar is not the lion's full roar, but it is shorter than the snarly's, loud-voiced roar.
Ocelots prefer small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can; almost all of the animals they prey on are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find predators that they can eat by sniffing, tracking their movements on the ground.
They have excellent night vision in the dark, and they move independently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then dropping their prey.
When a small group of organisms is separated from the larger group from which it came, such as being moved to a mountain or a river, or to a new island so that they cannot easily return, it likes to find itself in a society different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population needs new things or adaptations to be able to compete more strongly than we had in the beginning.
The real population has not changed at all, still needing the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new people begin to adjust to a new society, they gradually begin to become like other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means that the creation of a new species is natural. Speciation is the inevitable result of a change.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, they exhale).
Plants use the sun's photosynthetic process to produce food and shade.
We build our homes with plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food is plant food. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus reptiles were the most voracious predators of their time, so they feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long teeth had more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as an additional jaw, which meant that nothing could escape its path.
We are not certain, but it may have been bilingual. It ate large fish, other masaurs, and may have been carnivorous.
It attacks anything that dives in water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex would not be able to resist it.
Although many of their foods are unfamiliar to us, the Romans have a side of the food that surprises us with such things as wild boar, pikoko, turkeys, and a type of mouse called the dormouse
Another difference is that while the poor and the woman ate their meals seated in chairs, the rich men preferred to have meals together where they sat side by side while eating their meals.
The ancient Roman diet could not have included foods from Europe in America or Asia in the previous century.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to their god that was known as the home of their god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the gods' needs with ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard, with an inner sanctuary that was reserved for priests.
Occasionally, separate structures, called ziggurats, were built for church membership.
The top of the tower was the place of an idol.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not important.
Most of the life in the Hebrew family took place in space.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops had counters facing the street.
And there are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood is very expensive.
Greenland was settled on a small scale. In the Norse sagas they say Erik the Red was banished to Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his findings, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country is 'Scandinavia,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has an inscription on the back, it is not a map of wealth.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "First Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, a large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was folded for storage.
Now, the bribe may have been marked as a bribe.
The landing of D-Day and subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was not.
It was condemned by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of being counted.
On August 15, 1940, the United Nations invaded southern France, in an operation known as Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and French troops had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
Enlightenment is a single tradition shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning Latin, which is cognate with the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in some sense describes the size of a community.
Urban cities are the hubs of nations. Civilization describes the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the remaining cultural distance and the appropriate distribution.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving a valid historical record and are too small to be considered modern developments.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states began to form a weak central government - with Congress the only one subject to the Articles of Confederation.
The legislature had no powers to levy taxes, and for the reason that it had no national administrators or judges, it depended on the state authorities, who had sometimes not cooperated, to enforce all its laws.
It also had no authority to override tax and tariff laws between comments.
The Articles required explicit consent from all the provinces before they could be amended and the provinces so despised the central government that their representatives were not regularly present.
Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the Nordic leagues, and Italians compete in the World Championships and the Olympic Games.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the largest island country in the world.
Because of the archipelago of islands that Japan comprises, Japan is often referred to in geography as an "archipelago"
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European explorers recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a revolution in the production of grain products and hiring Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas and Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after victory in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimoneki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which administered the island until 1945.
Manchu Pichu has three important buildings, the Intihuanta, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Many of the buildings alongside the complex have been constructed to give visitors a better idea of their original origins.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reclaimed and the recovery is continuing to this day.
For example, the most common film for landscape photography is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but more importantly its ratio was taken over by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm species is a breed of goat, a breed of sheep, 36 mm long and 24 mm wide.
The format of this ratio (dividing by twelve to get a simple integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) equate to or approximate this ratio.
The widely misused and criticized law of the thumb is a simple guide to making variations while maintaining balance in the picture.
It says that the most effective point of the main heading is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
At this time in European history, the Roman Catholic Church, once rich in money and power, was viewed with suspicion.
For more than a millennium, Christianity united Europe despite its differences in culture and culture.
It is a countervailing force that affects from the king to the ruler.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
The church's legal head was Rome for over a thousand years and the pressure of money and power made the majority suspect that his constitution was correct.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to blockade German waters with naval forces.
The plan seemed to work, to cut off vital support from the military and the settlers, even though the ban violates the principle agreed upon in international treaties two centuries ago.
Britain dug up the country's waters to prevent ships from entering the open seas, harming innocent shipping.
With no unusual response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response in its unrestricted naval warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of the citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations have wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a distinct way of marking the different eras; each Chinese rank or ruling family was a different class.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch of 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times a bitter struggle was going on between the royal contenders for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was the bloodiest in the history of Ancient China, with many people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the palace of Xian.
There are many social and political consequences such as the introduction of the metric system, the change from absolutism, to republicanism and nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to its people and not to the ruler alone.
And after the Revolution's work is open to all applicants to allow the most awarded and successful to win.
The same goes for the military because instead of the military being based on class it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed migrant workers to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond the everyday life. He often went to the cave known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cover, which survived the times, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Resting on the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
After all, it's not easy to find out if someone knew it existed.
Nothing is hidden from view except the clear, beautiful clouds above and the many mountains around. Little of the world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only survivor of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
Built by the Egyptians in the third millennium, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest constructions built in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" The Egyptian district of the underworld has a number of pyramids (the largest of which is also the largest), a number of tombs, a number of temples, and a huge Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol i-up bow is V-shaped and u-down bow is u-shaped or a square not complete on the lower side.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the arrow, and down means you have to start at the cell (where your hand holds the arrow) and pull the arrow.
An upward-pointing arrow usually produces a low-pitched sound, whereas a downward-pointing arrow is strong and powerful.
Put your pencil notes in freely, but remember that the printed curve notes are there for the sake of the music, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced on 6th October 1789 to return to Paris from Versailles by the forces of the Marquis.
With a chorus, they headed back to Paris surrounded by a mob shouting threats at the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
A member of the court once held up the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles to the frightened queen
The cost of the U.S. imperialist war in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial authorities to meet the enormous expenditure and bond revenue on behalf of the Philippine government to the Wall Street housing banks.
Of course, the massive profits made from exploiting the Filipino people are the profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that led to the formation of the Order.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, usually ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many aspects of everyday life, from technological progress or technological significance to the radical conclusion that the future of humanity is the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most of the discoveries of technological determinism fall into two categories: that technological development itself follows a path that is more transcultural or political in nature, and that technology also has effects on independent, rather than human-dominated nations.
For example, one might say that transportation leads to road development.
However, road connections are not profitable because of the low number of vehicles, so new development methods must be devised to reduce the cost of ownership.
More vehicles leads to an increased risk of road accidents, which leads to new ideas in health care and self-medication.
Romanticism had a great deal to say about culture, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the case of Romanism, geography shaped the people, and over time customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these, in accordance with the social space, were superior to the established laws.
In this way Paris became known as the fashion capital of the modern world, while Constantinople was thought of as the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until it was hit around 1100 A.D.
Its decline during the 12th century was largely due to travellers returning with gifts such as silk, spices that were valued above the supply of the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The dress was originally heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
However, because of slow communication, western styles would lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own style. The major development of the period was the use of buttons to decorate clothing.
Sustainable agriculture is the cultivation of crops with the aim of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his household.
Organic farming is a simple, often fertile, system of preserving local seeds that combines with rotation of a crop species or any other type to increase yields.
Historically most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary due to age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a different culture such as language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sex, geography, or a combination of these.
Members of the culture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, etiquette, and style.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of social contact is to take a few unfortunate cases where children have been neglected, traumatized, or intentionally abused, excluded from society by people who were unkind to them while growing up.
Some natural children are confined by humans (usually their parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe mental or physical disability.
Abused children may have been severely abused before being abandoned or fleeing.
Some are accused of having been adopted by animals; others are said to have been isolated in the wild.
When raised by a nonhuman primate, a baby exhibits traits that are inherently similar to those of its caretaker, such as fears and prejudice.
While project-oriented learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding stage takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support method that provides support for people learning new skills such as using a computer program or starting a new job.
Scaffolds can look real and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but so is a paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Visual Scaffolds are built into the software and are designed to query, accelerate, and define processes that would be challenging for a learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Child Support Services for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in a culture that is uneducated, uncaring, and uneducated, but it happens.
We see the Child Care Program as a safe haven for these children.
Our child-care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
A foster home should provide for all the shortcomings of the home from which they were taken.
The Internet connects these two things as well as communication between people.
The clear patterns of the internet architecture lead to other levels of user experience and style satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "connecting with others" are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Engagement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they surveyed audience responses to websites.
The use of video and recording has made important discoveries in understanding subtle facial expressions, facial movements that last for a few seconds.
Specifically, it is said that a person can detect a lie by interpreting the facial expressions accurately.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, showed that people who are speech-impaired because of brain damage are able to access the truth accurately.
He even suggests that the ability to interpret human gestures may even exist in domestic animals, such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has revealed two pockets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds genetic diversity, while selection removes it from the pool of varieties presented.
Division and amalgamation push the species back and forth between the age groups.
In the lowland area, it is difficult for man to meet his amino-acid needs using available plants.
Besides, doing so has serious consequences: increased stress, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant protein is found in leaves and legumes, but the food or people they consume are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ant, fox, eggs) are easily digested, and there are high-quality, healing carbohydrates that contain all the amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as desert monkeys do today.
A sleep disturbance is a condition in which you wake up at your usual bedtime and go to sleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done simply by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to your senses without fully awakening you.
If you find that you simply turn off the clock when it wakes you up, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a laxative) before bedtime, forcing one to get up and urinate.
The degree of peace a person has is proportional to the degree of anxiety a person has in his body and soul.
The less stress, the more vitality there is. Everyone can find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing standing in our way to this stage is our self-control and lack of confidence.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on the teachings of the Buddha, but they are supplemented by the Mahayana form of love and by the steady path from Indian Yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of light) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and sight.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. Through the sight of various deities energy pathways are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened knowledge is acquired.
Germany was a foe to many people during World War II, which led to the alliance between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the clashes of policy, culture, and culture led to the breakup of the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former friends became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be sought by armies in wars from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish forces had been defeated, and the only hope was to withdraw, making adjustments on the Romanian side of the bridge.
However, these plans were disrupted almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian-Ukrainian border after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The cargo ship is the most reliable means of transporting large numbers of people and cargo across the coasts.
The traditional role of ships was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to transport your people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were constantly moving men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop the convoy.
If the Allies had not won, Germany might have conquered Britain because the rest of Europe was in its hands.
Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or any pasture, tended by shepherds who were usually young or even young men, like the famous shepherds.
Wagonways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons had wooden planks placed sideways, they allowed the horses to pull them at higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of those days.
Crossties were soon introduced to hold the tracks in place, but it was realised that the tracks would be more effective if they carried metal on top.
This was common, but iron caused wear on the wheels of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron rails were built.
The first form of walking was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (that is, the upright man).
Its predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is like treating addictions in many cases. However, if we don't want a short-term solution, we have to look for the causes, so that we can stop them.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of advances in science and technology, and problems have increased because of the increase in population and the way people live.
After its passage by the House on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by House Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and sent to the printers at John Dunlap's nearby store.
At night between 150 and 200 copies are made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, to be read with his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 large Dunlap copies known to exist are the oldest known copies of the document.
Most paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Most people do not think of dinosaurs as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there is more to birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information stored in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number is a two-digit number, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits  or bits in computer programming.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that they may not be contagious.
The main sign of internal corrosion is the presence of a container of a dangerous drug or household chemical.
Refer to the first-aid instructions for a particular toxin.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady as she needed a lavatory.
The name has long been associated with bedbugs, insects that can eat humans.
Both the Assassin-bugs and the Bed-bugs are unpredictable, organized to live in the cage or in the houses of their master.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 people known to have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading mental illness among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that they are not fit to raise their own child, or they may even think that their own child is not fit to raise their own child.
The couple may choose to make arrangements for the adoption of their child.
When adopting a child, the biological parents relinquish parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary purpose of science is to discover how the world works in a scientific way, and this is the basis for much scientific research.
Not only is the experiment, the experiment, and the experiment a test used to remove one or more assumptions, but questions are asked and considerations are made that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
The most widely accepted were Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek intellectuals and its scientific roots.
Many observe rhythms in appearance and patterns that depend largely on the presence of these endogenous cycles and their development over the natural period.
The rhythm of the seasons, which is not simply a response to external seasonal factors, has already been recorded in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks create oscillators that will continue to rotate freely even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into the virus.
They performed two tests to mark either DNA on a sheet of radioactive phosphorus or a phage protein on a sheet of sulfur fumes.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved are germ-line cells.
Only changes in the bacterial lineage can be passed on to children, whereas changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting for the purpose of observing nature and its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, parks, and natural history.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about the organgatuangs in Orneum.
Every morning, people leave the country's villages in their cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by fellow workers from the place they have just left.
In this transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that the carbon economy has been displaced from one of its stable environments that supported human evolution two million years ago.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, for example, the same complaints about water quality and collapsing bridges are heard from time to time.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers unable to work? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic is the study of how each driver and car travel from one place to another and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic congestion is difficult because the driver's actions cannot be fully imitated.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave well within the ideal range; however, the road currents tend to have a good consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To be a better representation of traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly allows them to evade predators and to find food more easily.
Many insects have a mechanism that allows them to fold their wings to the side of their body.
This gives them many small hiding places for other animals.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings are flies and mosquitoes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed otherwise; that the Solar System revolves around the earth, including the sun and other stars).
It seems to be conscious, because the Earth doesn't sound moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river in the world, with a water volume more than eight times that of the second-largest river in the world.
The Amazon is the largest river in the world, in some places more than six miles wide.
The Amazon provides 20 percent of the total water that flows from the world's rivers to the sea.
The Amazon River is the largest, 6,387 miles (3,980 km) long, and it draws water from thousands of tributaries.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were not surpassed in size and sophistication.
The new kingdom of ancient Egypt was awed by the monuments of its former, more than a thousand-year-old, empire.
With a population of just 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in administration and official correspondence.
Italian is once again the language of the working classes, and Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
The Vatican is all Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper for a long time, as they can all be obtained in nature in a natural way and are much easier to mine with ancient tools.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that the physical universe was composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four dimensions of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought they changed into new forms to form what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
You can also find alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything on Earth is made of matter, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them, when put together, form the punctuation mark at the end of a sentence.
Thus, the pencil became the best friend of many people when it was invented.
Sadly, as new writing methods have developed, the pencil has been reduced to a minor role and use.
People now text on computer screens, never going near the truck.
One might wonder what the keyboard will be like when a new invention is born.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It is like lifting a cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to break apart with little or no suspicion.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The land is 70 kilometres wide and 100 kilometres wide in the far direction.
It is thin under the harbor and thick under the high ground.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easy for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding what makes people brand or appeal to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs or desires that have been kept inside as a person grows older.
These theories look at what motivates people to act the way they do and what factors in their environment influence them to act the way they do.
Two popular theories are Themous' Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviours can arise as managers begin to lead their former peers. The other end of the show is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or the gals).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking corrective action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, a change agent is a stranger who feels that he must change everything that the group has done and make it his own.
After all, a leader is always responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This practice tends to have ripple effects between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Internet teams must meet the same standards as the mainstream, but there are some minor differences.
The members of a proper team often act as a point of contact for their physical team.
They tend to have more independence than the average group member as their groups may meet at different times without the understanding of their local superiors.
The existence of a real "invisible" group (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a feature of the visible group.
The invisible group is the governing body to which the officers report. The invisible group sets the level of each officer.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning society? One purpose of setting up learning contracts for an organization is to design.
When all the tools are used in the right way in all parts of the organization, the quality and reliability can be evident.
As a result, a system of organizations working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new system of serving customer needs.
Before a company can innovate, management must create a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing as well as learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuity approach as the most widely used approach to help organizations achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobilogy data provide tangible evidence for the theory of the brain.
The link between brain pathology and habits supports scientists in research
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, bruises, and ulcers affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that were previously unknown.
This provides us with a wealth of information and tools to create simulation models that help us understand what is going on in our minds.
Although AI has a non-scientific dimension, AI forms an important foundation in the field of computer science dealing with patterns, learning and machine intelligence.
Research in AI involves making machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, responding to customer mistakes and questions, identifying handwriting, and matching voice and facial expressions.
Such things have become a series of sections, aimed at providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into computer and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Often the teacher will take his students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology provides a solution through virtual field trips. Students can look at archaeological artifacts, visit an aquarium, or view fine art while sitting in their classroom.
A field trip is almost another way of exploring and discussing ideas with students for the future.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help improve students' writing. Although readers often bring their blog experiences with poor grammar, and poor spelling, if people read them, it often changes that.
Since readers are often audiences with nothing to say, the blogger begins to work on improving his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces readers to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's curiosity encourages readers to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration, and encourages readers to expand their reading beyond the traditional religious tradition.
Proper use of blogs "can empower readers to be more critical and critical; by actively responding to online resources, readers can express their position on the context of others' writings and express their own views on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful capital with a bilingual or multilingual population, several galleries, and museums that display Canada's history and modernity.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these and more mark Ontario as a typical Canadian place.
Large areas in the north have few inhabitants and some are almost uninhabited.
A demographic comparison that shocks many: There are more African Americans living in the US than in Canada.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.

For women: It is recommended that female tourists report that they are married, whether married or single.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not in a way that seems too ostentatious.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they perceive as harassment and not normal to be followed, held in the arm, etc.
Be confident in your pursuit of men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan had rebuilt the city as Daru Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish architects who created the commercial posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most attractive shopping areas in Morocco.
In the old Medina it is easy to find stalls selling traditional Moroccan clothing, such as tags, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and full-length geegaws, but all for tourists.
Goma is a popular tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo on that eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably secure, all visits outside Goma must be investigated to understand the nature of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo, as well as for the less expensive African Gorillas.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel to areas in Goma. The average (local) cost is 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Coupled with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has long been used as a metaphor for distant, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, though its name makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, because of its desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
This city is not in sync with other cities in the country, for it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.

The Sundarbans is the world's longest coastal strip, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and into the Indian interior from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the Indian subcontinent is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not mangrove swamps - but they include the last remnants of the vast forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/marshland.
Since 1966 the Sundbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and there are now an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 tiger leopards in the wild.
Buses leave the inter-district station (across the river) all day, although the lowest, mainly eastbound buses to Jakar/Bumthang run between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the district buses are always crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts are served by the small Japanese Coaster buses, which are of good quality and are well-traveled.
Shared taxis are a quick and pleasant way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.

The flat-bottomed bridge is 15 metres (49 ft) high. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living a hunter - gatherer and subsisting on agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, harvesting, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, once called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was founded as a result of the raids of Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial era.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its cultural heritage.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.

The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands and within the islands Stanley credit cards and US dollars are generally accepted.
In the outer islands paper money may be accepted, but British and American currency is not; check with the owners of the portfolios to find out which payment method is more suitable.
It is almost impossible to change money in the Falklands outside the island, so change your currency before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is alternately summer there and winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the tropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be tricky with cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it sound colder than the thermometer would indicate.
There are no "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is wild and should not be disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Whatever their appearance, buffalo, elk, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack you.
Every year, tourists are injured because they do not keep the right distance. These animals are big, fierce and dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that the scent attracts bears and other forest animals, so be careful when handling or cooking food and keep the camp clean.

Stirrups are supports for the driver that hang down the foot on the sides of the saddle.
They provide more support for the rider but raise safety concerns because the rider's legs can get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse and his foot gets caught in the arrows, he can be pulled if the horse is running. To reduce the risk, several things must be considered first.
First, most passengers wear high-heeled boots and a pair of soles with a bow and arrow.
Next, some Saddles, especially the British, have safety features that cause leather belts to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.

The skiing process is similar to the hiking process.
When conditions allow, you will be able to travel longer distances than you would on foot  but you will rarely travel at the speed of skiing with poles without a backpack on paved roads.
Europe is a small continent but is home to many independent countries. Outside normal circumstances, traveling to many countries may mean applying for a visa and a passport repeatedly.
The Schengen zone, however, operates as if it were a single country.
If you live in this area, you will cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for various Schengen countries, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes antiquity, and some tax agencies classify items as being over 100 years old.
The explanation varies from place to place, where the average age may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques, even though they may be newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sámi, and the tradition associated with this industry is important to people in other professions as well.
Traditionally, though, not all Sámi are involved in the active hunting of the frogs, living off fishing, hunting and so on, with the frogs as working animals.
Today many Sámi work in the timber industry, and tourism is the main source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Gypsies, the term "Gypsy" is considered derogatory because it is associated with negative thoughts and prejudice against the Roma.
If the country you are going to visit has travel advisories, your travel insurance or your cancellation insurance may be affected.
