Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists believe that the animal's feathers were brown at the top and brown or yellowish at the bottom.
The invention also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed plumage called a feather tail, but have other features of feathers, such as a pointed beard and a beak, researchers have suggested that the feather tail was likely the result of a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows an adult feather rather than a chick.
The researchers speculate that although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows an adult feather, not a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the Gaziantep Police Station in Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They found that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as the other stars, that all the stars in the system were driven by their light, by their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is related to the flow of the plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversal.

The work that was done was largely theoretical, but the program was written to promote observations from the Milky Way.
The effect the team was looking for would be created by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts its gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts its force on the Milky Way galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is in the form of a halo surrounding the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of TB (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very, very worrying and alarming" because of the very high death rate.
Dr. Mol believes that some of the patients may have been infected with the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital nurses.

Voting in France has traditionally been done using simple technology: Voters are isolated in a voting booth, put a pre-printed ballot paper in an envelope, and indicate the candidate they have chosen.
Once the official validates the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
The French electoral law is quite strict about the information.
Since 1988, polling stations have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes have been added (except those that have been properly counted and allocated to voters).
Candidates may send representatives to attend in person each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict controlled conditions, following special procedures.

Four skaters in the women's sitting group failed their race, and 45 of the 117 skaters in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Aryan said: "We have arrested five men who raped a Swiss woman and have returned her cell phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had come to the court wearing face veils.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first transferred to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his son.
He was in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence could have been compromised because his image had been widely published.
This is generally a common practice in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said that "journalists are putting themselves at risk by publishing photos and other material of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute: Palestine wants the borders to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which was sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
In the additional pest control trial, the fires were subject to direct supervision by rangers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Archery Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who is the acting director of Zbosoygo Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had undergone extensive safety and training.
Yesterday, the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council swore Martelli to office.
It's the fifth package in four years from Martell's express mail.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the ruling power that began in October.
Sometimes, the failure to hold elections has been the catalyst for violent protests, some as far back as 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reported incidents of iPod heating malfunctions, resulting in six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more cases of overheating, which the company called "serious".
The ministry had condemned the delay in the Apple report as "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m. GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage in the country.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
A few hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six prisoners, including children and adults, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed a bathroom.
The Ligginses followed in their father's footsteps and chose to become doctors.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm births in her spare time.
His research suggests that maturing of the fetal lungs can be accelerated by administering a single hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes of flight recordings on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first boss. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Just as special as she was. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldstein Runnels noted that Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more so... that he loved her and would miss her... hoping she was in a better place.
In a poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during her 2010 federal election campaign, claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view: they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the last survey, 29% of respondents believed that Australia would become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia would never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary pills to manage his pain because they are prohibited by the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supply to Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support survival.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described the gossip as "political rhetoric and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the old ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided, and no underground trains will stop at Wembley, and onshore car parking, vehicle parking and other transportation facilities are unavailable.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that they would have to play the game behind closed doors without any team supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it is thought that this process took much longer due to a cross between Darwin's endemic serinos, a medium-sized terrestrial serinos, and the dry cactus serinos, the serinos conirosis.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be rolled into tiny molds.
It can be pulled by thin metal wire that can be rolled and stitched. It can be rolled or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and inserted into another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. You can use red cabbage juice as a gauge.
Cabbage juice changes color (in the case of a beet) depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical composition is.
The pH level in a chemical compound under test is indicated by the number of hydrogen (H) ions in the pH.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons disconnected from each other (as hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powder masks together and then, with clean, wet hands, crush it into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will be ridiculous, and create a kind of shield.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every home has a toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of plumbing systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of a public bath, where men and women were allowed to be together in the same place.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives the call and responds almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a giant rocket that's 100 feet long.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it's done is provide us with easier and faster transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other modes of transportation.
Most of them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to deer and deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on many more small prey, such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea of the orphan, that each cat has a specific job that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prairies.
Prides are composed of one to three consanguineous adult males, with up to thirty eggs and young.
Females are usually more closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride more often act as wolf or dog packs, the animals are strikingly similar in behaviour to lions (but not other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-developed athlete, the tiger can juggle (not so well, though), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, tigers, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can purr.
The tiger's roar is not the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a single phrase of muttering, screaming words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals. When given the opportunity, it will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate their prey by scent, sniffing out all the places on the ground where they have been.
With night vision, they can see very well and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then attacking it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will permanently appear in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics and different adaptability than it did before to compete strongly.
The native population hasn't changed at all, they need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that it's not possible to call them the same species.
We call this process "specification", which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they inhale carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that's what air is).
Plants get their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mozaza was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything but other Moza.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 sharp, charcoal-like teeth, with an additional row at the top of its mouth, meaning that anything that crossed its path could not escape it.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, and its diet included frogs, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could even have been a man-eater.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even the giant dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus Rex, it was nothing to it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans carried strange or unusual animal items, including wild boar, amphibians, lizards and a species of rodent called the tambourine.
Another option was that while the poor men and women sat on chairs eating their bread, the rich men liked to have banquets together, where they would sit side by side eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that had come from Europe, America, Asia in the past centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, a central temple, which was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by means of rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests may enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temple, special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were open showcases facing the street, and stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norwegian lay historians note that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered it and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were many.
If you've seen the movie Treasures of the Nation, you might think that the treasure map was on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Despite the fact that it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were: Original Declaration of Independence` dated July 4, 1776. The text appears in italics on the bottom of the document `.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large vellum document was previously in storage (measuring 293⁄4 inches long by 241⁄2 inches wide).
So it's possible that the footnote was added as a simple trademark.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting for them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies conquered Southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, American and French independent forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a fairly large group of people living and cooperating together: society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilization, which is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this also somehow defines the dimensions of society.
City states are the prototypes of nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, long cultural traces, and the equitable distribution of information.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and thus are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, where under the Articles of Confederation, Congress was its only component.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state governments, which often refused to cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
It also did not have the power to override tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after Germany, and was the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to Japan's island grouping, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a reorganization of the local grain cultivation practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was proclaimed a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used format for photographic still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size near the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, 36mm wide, 24mm high.
So the ratio of the sides of this pattern (divided by twelve so that we can get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is, as we say, 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to this ratio of sides.
The much-abused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics by keeping order size in the picture.
It notes that the most effective part of the main theme is the intersection point, which divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
The Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, came under control at this time in European history.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
Its supremacy of universal power affected everyone from kings to mere mortals.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central structure of the church had been in Rome for nearly a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this doctrine had been maintained.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been effective in cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian goods, even though this blockade violated universally accepted international law, enshrined in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain was dredging international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine fleet's unlimited warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant approach of many citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of that situation.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems, and a promissory note from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods: each dynasty or dynasty of China was considered a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability with states divided between each dynasty. The most prominent of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
This region was the scene of fierce fighting between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a number of social and political influences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just one ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the military ranking based on rank, they were now based on size.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life, and for meditation he often visited a cave on Mount Hira, known as the Nur.
The cave, which has survived the test of time, is a vivid illustration of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if someone knows it existed.
The view is limited to the beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century B.C.E. It is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau of Egypt's Valley of the Dead, or the "Necropolis of Giza", contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The upper arch is V-shaped, while the lower arch is a square with a missing bottom edge.
Up means you start at the top and pull the bow, and down means you start at the end of the rod, where your hand is holding the bow, and pull the bow.
A high bow is usually softer, while a low bow is louder and more consistent.
You can use a pencil for your own notes, but remember that the printed humble notes are there for musical purposes, so usually they have to be taken into account.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth of Loches, were forced to flee Versailles for Paris after being attacked by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a chariot surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats at the queen and the king.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the window of their chariot wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal soldier killed at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The US imperialist war to take over the Philippines was paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial administration to cover most of the interest and costs on the bonds that were placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking structures.
Of course, the profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that contributed to the formation of the order.
The year in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the Early Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, terminating approximately in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the very notion that human destiny is driven forward by fundamental logic, coupled with scientific laws and other manifestations of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has effects on individual societies rather than society-driven.
For example, we can say that a car with a motor inevitably leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The massive ownership of cars on the road also leads to a large number of accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the healthcare field to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism is a major element of cultural determinism, seen in writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and culture associated with that geography grew, and the latter, being in harmony with the wildness of society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
As the epicenter of the plague, it became famous around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined especially due to the fact that the Crusaders returned to the island bringing with them gifts such as silk items and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the fashion capital changed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic flourished in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Early dress in the East was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication routes, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of that time was the use of buttons to secure clothing, which was a result of the Crusades.
The goal of subsistence farming is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds specifically preserved for an ecological region (s) in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, many farmers have been consumer agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Ethnicities may be different because of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a particular subset can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often communicate their membership through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style that involves fashionableness, satire, and misuse of terms.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to look at a few unfortunate cases of children who, having gone through neglect, misfortune, and intentional abuse by adults, were not socialized by adults as they aged.
Such children are called "abandoned" or "wild". Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their parents themselves). In some cases, abandonment has been due to a parent's refusal to severely injure the child mentally or physically.
Wild children may have experienced cruel exploitation or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived independently in the wild.
When a feral child is raised by a non-domesticated animal, he or she exhibits behavior (in physical terms) that is almost entirely similar to that of particularly wary animals, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While the programming courses are supposed to make learning easier and more fun, code engineering is a step further.
Code generation is not a teaching method but rather an aid, supporting individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stickers can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of stick, but so is the man with the little file cabinet in the Microsoft office.
Virtual logs are integrated into the software and are designed to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that might have been difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even abuse.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nourished, cared for and educated, but there are still those.
We think that the foster family system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The adoptive family is supposed to provide for all the needs that were not provided for in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and in-person communication.
The unique nature of the Internet leads to additional criteria in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialising" have been suggested as important motives for using the Internet. - James et al., 1995.
Amy and McCord also considered "personal engagement" and "continuing relationships" to be aspects of having new motivations (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
Video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, they claim that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who have a disability due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genealogical change, and selection removes it from the list of changes that have been demonstrated.
Torture and recombination confuse the changes between the two units in each generation.
Out on the savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive system has a hard time meeting its amino acid needs with the resources available to plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins that were available in the leaves and the leaf blades, but like us, primates have a hard time digesting them unless they're cooked.
Unlike animals, ants, termites, eggs, not only are they easier to digest, but they also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
So, given all of these circumstances, it shouldn't surprise us to learn that our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep and then going back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes later).
This can be done quite easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you change the alarm clock again when you go to sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, the famous urine) before bedtime, which will make a person wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in the body and the mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the energy you have towards life.
Anyone can get an education. The only thing that's stopping us from getting it is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but spread through the Mahayana path of love and the many tricks of Indian yoga.
In its basic form, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's a combination of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of light) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and meditations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, where the visualization of various gods clears energy pathways, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation of the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts forced the countries to abandon the agreement.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and replacement, real armies were to fight battles from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when some 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods has long been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has been to ensure that your country can keep its people and its goods moving, while at the same time preventing your enemy from moving their people and their goods.
One recent notable example of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to close the passage.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably been able to invade Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them to make milk, hair, meat and flour readily available.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or pastures, often followed by goats, usually children or teenagers, as were herders with more extensive ranges. These methods of breeding are still used today.
The footpaths were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the relatively less smooth roads of the day.
Railroad spikes were introduced early on to hold railroad tracks in place, but it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if they were covered with iron from above.
This became standard practice, but the iron on the wooden wheels of the carriages caused more wear.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron lines were introduced.
The first known vehicle was walking, and human beings started walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
The two-legged specialization was found in the fossil record of the Australopithecus between 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally consciously, we can join the environmental movement and we can become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It's just like symptomatic treatment in many ways, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and get rid of it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased because of overpopulation and the unrestrained way people live.
When Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Congressman Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as the Dunleaf Broadcasts.
On July 8, the document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. An example arrived in London on August 10.
Today, the 25 Dunlop Lines that are known to still exist are the oldest extant examples of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot of talk about birds that are still considered dinosaur-like.
They have spotted legs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number system can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits, if we use computer language.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal intoxication may be the presence of an open container of a drug or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for the first-aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term medium is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects in an official sense.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with woodpeckers, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Killer insects and woodpeckers are sedentary, adapted to live in the host's nest or community.
There are about 400,000 documented cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States, proving that it's still the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
Cerebral palsy is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely as men to have a master's degree in science.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the adoptive parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The fundamental purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and this method actually guides basic scientific research.
But it's not just an experiment, it's a test that uses questions to disprove one or more of the possible hypotheses, and observations also guide scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists turned their attention to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views have been adopted in all areas of science, including psychology.
The decline of Greek knowledge caused the West to break away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that the repetition of physiology and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the creation of endogenous cycles by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Our biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will keep spinning freely even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is the stuff of origin.
Hersh and Chase used phages and viruses to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling DNA with radioactive phosphorus in the phase or radioactive sulfur from the phase protein.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are embryonic cells.
Only embryonic cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural sites to enjoy the scenery as well as the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small suburban towns to their workplaces, meeting others on the way who have jobs in the same towns they just left.
Everyone on this high-speed commuter train is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has diverted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone is unhappy with the state of transportation systems.
You don't hear this level of complaint in developed countries about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are transportation systems such a source of complaint, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers not professionals, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it's impossible to predict the behavior of a driver 100 percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to keep a fairly consistent distance, so the traffic flow tends to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, a relationship has been established between three main parameters: 1) flow, 2) density and 3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design, and operate road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators, scavenge for food, and find mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them small spaces to hide from a wide range of predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are the beetles and the orcas.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth, and the first largest river on Earth, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles wide in some parts.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans in the world's rivers flows from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it is the source of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-shaped structures made of stone survived into the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were by then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of the country's working people, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The Vatican City is a Roman Catholic city.
In the ancient world, people knew about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because these were naturally found in nature and were relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same sequence) ̋ solid, liquid, gas and plasma, though he also suggests that they are transformed into new materials ̋ to form what we see.
And the alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them would fit into the end of this sentence alone.
So when the pencil first came out, it was a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as more and more new ways of writing came into existence, the pencil became less and less used and of lower status.
People are now typing messages on computer screens without ever having to reach for a pen.
One can only guess what the keyboard will look like when something new comes out.
The fission bomb works by the principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
The heavy cart is like rolling a hill up, splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no excitation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner in the water and thicker in the mountains.
There may be more eruptions on this side because the outer crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to get out onto the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people click or what makes them feel engaged.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature.
These theories are about finding out what makes some people want to do the things they do, and what environmental factors make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
There are two general behaviors that can emerge when managers start to take on their former peers: One end of the spectrum is trying to stay one of the "first guys" or "first girls".
This type of leader has difficulty making decisions that people don't like, implementing disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a creature is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything the team has done and take its own steps.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the contact person for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which can be confusing for their local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasco, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the benchmarks for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness can be demonstrated when all available resources in the functional functional departments of the organization are used effectively.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovation process that will serve the customer's needs.
Before any organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuous Approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence to support a theoretical approach to cognitive research, and therefore narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, infections and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see and explore the structure and processes of the brain in ways we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and smart device adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things become separate branches of science that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into several computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any course, and often a teacher would like to take his students to places that you can't go by bus.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing the excursion is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a registry.
Blogs can also be useful in improving students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with a poor grammar and spelling, the presence of readers mainly changes this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger struggles to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy the audience's curiosity inspires students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the confines of the traditional school day.
The normal use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical: by responding more actively to online material, students can define their positions in the context of other writers' writings, as well as on certain issues in order to outline their own perspectives (O'Rae, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is adorned with art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Beyond that to the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the natural beauty of the Muscoque and surrounding areas.
All of these and a few other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider to be a model Canadian city.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited deserts.
To compare the population, which surprises many, there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or attached to France and are known as luxury holiday beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it's come a long way in the Comoros and in Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (not one that is too expensive, of course).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, to be pulled by the hand, and so on.
Be determined to reject men and don't be afraid to speak up - whether it's a cultural difference or not, right?
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badia, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It's not hard to find places in Medina that sell traditional Moroccan items such as the tajī dish, the clay pot, leather goods, coconuts and a huge variety of magicians, but this is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, adjacent to Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption devastated Goma, covering most of the city streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the military operations that are ongoing in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the excavation of the Nyiragongo volcano, hunting some of the cheapest mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short walk is ~500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative untouchability, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it attractive to tourists, it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of Henry Lewis's main stops during the PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has more of an Arab than African flavor.
The Kruger National Park (KNN) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and south to the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different branches of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily maintenance and admission fees.
It can also be profitable to buy a Wild Card, which gives access to various parks in South Africa or the entire South African National Park.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major attraction for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline resemble a glittering pattern, made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To see the best of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite side, Kowloon Falls.
The bulk of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated in the reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place where the British colonists observed their own, so if you're looking for evidence of this place's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is considered the world's largest coastal belt of mangroves, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline across the inland regions of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part within the Indian Territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are more than just mangrove swamps. They include the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans area covers 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one-third is covered by water/saline sections.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and by rough estimates there are 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 black rhino in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-city bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although the eastbound and Jakarta/Bumintang trains depart between 06:30 - 07:30.
Since the buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many areas are served by small Japanese shore buses that are comfortable and durable.
Kiso taxis are a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punacha (No 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River and connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two rows of 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was even closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when work at Brazil's customs is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Paagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
The 16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Indian Colony", was created by the clash of Spanish conquistadors and native Indian tribes.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
When Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay was able to largely retain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the countries with the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and meetings are held here.
For information on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo games, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, across from the Falkland Islands Company's Western Shop.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, as are Stanley credit cards. United States dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted in remote islands, but British and US currency may be accepted, check with the owners in advance to see what payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your currency before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, with temperatures above +30 C in the summer months being common.
Winter can be deceptively cold - the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons; according to rough calculations, the amount of rainfall remains the same throughout the year.
Although most animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park's management, you must maintain a minimum distance of 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
As docile as they may seem, bison, reindeer, badgers, bears, and almost any other large animal can be attacked.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep enough distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that bears and other wild animals are attracted to odors, so avoid having or preparing smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval inactivity in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British warship was sunk, with about 200 Americans and Germans killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, the Supreme Leader Tupua Tamase Lellofi G was killed as a result of peaceful rallies in the city.
There are many beaches in Auckland because of the two harbours that surround it.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor region) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are all safe sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shaded areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mid Auckland's Mission Bay and St Helens.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with many different shops stretching along the coast.
The main local beer is Number One, a simple beer but with a pleasant and refreshing character. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better to consume.
The local tap water is perfectly drinkable, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of coffee with milk is foreign to Australians. The short black is espresso, the cappuccino is served with high cream (no flour), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is even by Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they taste great.
Many of the underwater cave expeditions are year-round, and injuries to underwater reefs for any of these reasons are very rare.
As always, listen to the authorities, follow all signs, and be alert to safety signals.
The box jellyfish are found near beaches and riverbanks from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Many sharks are afraid of people and swim away from shore.
Sea crocodiles don't just live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the riverbanks north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, although you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping through a travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination flight and hotel package.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as an entry visa) for the place you have chosen.
Although any changes and inquiries should be first discussed through a travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of visitors choose to camp at the venue, and many visitors consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the concert, you have to get in early to pitch the tent to the music.
Remember, even if the music has ended on the main stages, there may be some parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you decide to cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin layout, as going through the ice makes a rather awful noise to the most affected.
Sailing in St. Petersburg also includes a city break. Cruise passengers are exempt from entry visa requirements (check conditions).
Usually, casinos go to great lengths to make guests spend more time and money. There are no clocks or windows, and the exit is hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in high spirits and inside the building.
Some places offer alcohol in the home, but drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should watch for snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the contact is low, and you can't drive like you would on bare asphalt.
In the case of a snowflake, a lot of snow can fall in a very short period of time and cover you.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or melting on car windows or by fog or ice on them.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues in a mostly continuous fashion throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest attraction in Africa and the destination for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used for overland travel to observe the spectacular African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and leopards, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows them to get a good close-up view.
Lions, leopards, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they're best seen through binoculars.
A safari (also called a bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Several events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, held in 1964.
If you have booked your tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may be facing a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, all cancellations due to coronavirus are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets are expected to cost 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a sink and a sink table that can be rented even if no one is in the room.
If a polish is not available or if you do not like to wear polished socks, you may want to try a hair stylist.
Be careful not to overheat the piece (which can cause burning or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective for specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it takes a few minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying your water from a reputable company with a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them in their home environment.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or violently kill people are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping allows you to buy goods free of taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on items such as liquor and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most dangerous driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated deep forested terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your feelings to yourself: the bumps, the narrow tracks, the sharp turns, they're prevalent.
The speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections, 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it's more important to adhere to them than anything else.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, quite rich and varied, and the same can be said of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are popular, apple pies are made all year round, and caraway and salsa are fresh in the summer.
Many German pastry dishes include nuts, walnuts, and other tree nuts. The popular biscuits often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but filling pastry, try what is called a Berliner, a Pfankuchen, or a Krapf, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that is made with herbs and spices, either with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curries; in southern India and a few other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly added.
With a choice of about 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catchall term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.

The bars, which hang on either side of the tent, protect the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may have safety concerns, as there is a possibility that the rider's legs could get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but his foot remains in the stirrup, the horse may kick him if he runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, all riders wear heels and flat, fairly narrow insoles, designed for riding.
Then some camps, particularly English camps, have safety rails that allow the shoe's frame to hang from the camp when the falling rider pulls it back.
The Cochamo Valley is Chile's premier destination for scuba diving, known as the Yosemite of South America for its variety of large granite rocks and boulders.
The cliffs include magnificent views from the top, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the potential of its endless walls.
Cross-country skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing over snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.

Think of the ski trail as a kind of expedition trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat more distance than walking, but only very rarely will you be able to gather speed on a prepared track without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would mean applying for visas and going through passport controls several times.
But in this sense, the Schengen area works like one state.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen country, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered an antique, and some tax agencies classify items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition depends on geographical variations, where the age limit may be smaller in North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sami and surrounding culture, and trade is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, although not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, they did live off fishing, hunting and similar pursuits, keeping reindeer as the main breeding animal.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Boscha, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of the Boscha people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, this may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You might also want to ask for advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East can be confronted by Europeans or Arabs in a variety of situations.
Written advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are damned general and oversimplified, unlike the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, serious social division, or take human life.
Extreme weather can happen in any part of the world, and there are different types of extreme weather that can occur depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are the forms and effects of severe weather, such as storms, tornadoes, surface currents, and cyclones.
The regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include avalanches, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather hazards that may affect their area, as this may in turn affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
If you search the web for "Hostile Environment Training", you'll probably find the address of a local company.
The course will usually present all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with the help of practical experience.
The course will typically last 2-5 days and will include role-playing, mostly first aid information, and sometimes weapons skills.
Books and magazines on desert survival are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should be sure to have valid documents with them on their return journey.

In the post-9/11 era, security checkpoints have become even more tedious.
Trans people should not expect to be scanned in the preoperative phase, and their privacy and dignity should be left untouched.
Back currents are the backward flow of waves that form after they hit a beach, often a reef or something similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and in deep water, a strong current can form there.
Many deaths are the result of exhausting attempts to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming backwards is not as difficult as it used to be.
Try to find places where you won't be attacked again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for help.
Rebound shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who are able to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When you come home after living abroad, when you've adapted to a new culture and lost your home customs.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also required of travelers returning home.
One of the most interesting things about the children's section is the sound and light show of the pyramids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the performance starts.
You usually hear the voices of tourists and merchants all the time, and the story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
Swink is positioned as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and then the different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by a number of countries and have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km (75 mi) north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island in the settlement of Villa las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Disappear, where the still active volcano's flooded crater creates a magnificent natural harbor scene.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains here melt, become a plateau, then regroup to form the 360 km (220 mi) long Ellsworth Range bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Belt is home to the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Range, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (15,932 ft).
In remote areas where there is no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.

The service is often used by freight transport, including yacht charters, as well as expeditions, whose data is received remotely and has voice needs.
Your local telephone company should be able to give you more information about joining this service.
Travel and learning is becoming a more popular option for older programmers.
This is especially popular with graduates, allowing them to take a year off before college without interrupting their education.
In many cases, taking a placement course abroad can actually improve your chances of transferring to a higher education institution in your home country.
Usually, there's a tuition fee to get involved in these educational programs.
Finland is a major shipping terminal. The country of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands in its lakes and offshore archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a boat in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the offshore islands and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any cruise ship, smaller boats or even lighthouses provide a very different experience.
In Finland, sailing is a national pastime, with seven or eight people on each boat.
It corresponds to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite exceptional in the rest of the cases (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
A feature of most memorable Baltic sea voyages is the long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days, returning and sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on boat trips, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some of the brochures show the city of Berlin, Germany. As you can see in the map above, there is no sea near Berlin, and a visit to the city is not included in the cost of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced an accident.
It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's no different than the personal fears and insecurities that most people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens in flight can help overcome the fear that is based on unknown or uncontrollable phenomena.
Freight companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly, and time is often critical for business paperwork, trade, or emergency repair parts.
In some areas, the larger companies have their own planes, but in other areas and smaller firms, this has been a problem.
If they ship the goods by air, on some routes it can take days to get through customs and unloading.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations would not allow them to send their baggage to the country they were visiting without a passenger.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, to get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap; in practical terms, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than economy class and eleven times more for first class.
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on direct business flights or first-class seats to get from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the benefit of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic plagued by ethnic clashes.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

The harsh appearance of Parisians will quickly fade if you exhibit some basic signs of civility.
The Plitvice Lakes Park is a dense forest of mostly evergreen, coniferous and oak trees, and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide diversity of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soil types and different levels of elevation.
The area is also home to many species of animals and birds.
Rare species such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, bee, moose, wildcat, and hare can be found there, as well as many other, more common species.
Women visiting monasteries must wear robes that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially the bright colors, you will be greeted at the entrance by a monk or nun.
Men are also required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the pantry near the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you will not feel comfortable wearing these underwear. One size fits all men.
Mallorcan cuisine is similar to that of the Mediterranean, based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and olive oil in everything.
Pa amb oli is a simple evening meal, especially in summer, with olive oil bread, tomatoes and any seasoning such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All pronouns, including the word for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

Pre-modern observatories are now generally disused and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in the past as it is today, they're usually located in cities or on college campuses, where they're easier to get to than the ones that are built today.
The most advanced research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of the flowering of the ballet, known as the hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

All the animals that originally came to the islands came here either by swimming or flying or by the current of the water.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from travelling, and the giant frog became the primary grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since man set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have emerged, including goats, horses, cows, rats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you'll see the polar night, which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
