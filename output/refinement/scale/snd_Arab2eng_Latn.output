It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that was already widely accepted, but also gives details that cannot normally be determined from fossils such as color and the triangular arrangement.
Scientists believe that the color of this animal's wings is yellow on the top surface or light brown on the inside, like a carotenoid color.
The discovery also gives insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur wings do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of wings - barbs and barbiolus - researchers speculate that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but instead for regulating body temperature or display. Researchers suggest that, although it is a young dinosaur tail, it shows the feathers of a simple young bird, not a chicken.
Researchers suggest that, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur, it is not the tail of a small bird, but rather the tail of a large bird.

He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeboye is currently facing charges for murdering his son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is being held pending charges and a hearing, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised because his image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts saw the publication of the images as potentially prejudicial.
"Journalists have taken a dangerous path by publishing images of suspects," notes Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee.
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, told reporters that no further comments would be made until the defendant is charged.
According to the leak, the document would refer to the border dispute, which Palestine has desired to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East conflict borders.
Other topics apparently covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
When an agreement is signed, Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA is only willing to accept their presence for five years.
The shooters were closely monitored by rangers during the additional pest control trial, as the trial itself was being monitored and assessed.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Incorporation, eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to McOfflin, the acting director of NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in as a member of the newly-elected Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the old CEP as part of a package of suggestions to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the commission on the anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally, violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some as early as 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of damaged iPods and overheating have been reported, resulting in four people suffering minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry in response called the delay in reporting by Apple "extremely regrettable".
The earthquake struck at 07:19 am local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday) in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reported that no damage of any kind has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostage a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several prisoners have been released and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
6 prisoners, including children and the elderly, were released, among them a Filipino photographer.
The photographers stepped in for the elderly woman as she needed to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Legan followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Lagens began to investigate underage labor in his spare time.
His research indicated that if a hormone is increased, it accelerates the development of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow pilots also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the underworld. My first manager. Luna spent many a moonlit night. She was incomparable."
Dustin "Goldie" Reynolds commented that "Luna was as scared as I am, maybe even more... I love her and I miss her... Hope she's in a better place."
Polling conducted prior to the 2010 federal election of 1,400 people showed that opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme end of the poll, 29% of people surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% say Australia will never become a republic.
She was on the brink of winning Olympic gold medals in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness was in doubt due to her complaints.
He has not been able to alleviate his pain by abstaining from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the invention using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comet may have been a source of water to the Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because it is believed that a protostar collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
She is convinced to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims helps airplanes fly on more direct routes, saves millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
This system uses satellite technology to supersede the older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircrafts with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport is being provided and there are no underground trains at Wembley, nor park and ride facilities at the ground.
Fears of a shortage in ridership increased the likelihood that the game would be played behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the sexes only evolved in two species, although it was thought that the process took longer due to breeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geosapza fortressis, and the exotic cactus finch, Geosapza coniferostris.
Gold can be transformed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be pulled with a fine wire, which can be twisted and pulled. Its rod can be made or rolled into rolls.
It can be very thick and adhere to other metals. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make a tracer by using the juice of the red clover.
The juice of the closed gourd changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (H in pH) atoms in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean hands, work them into the hair.
The gum in your hand will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and create a kind of tremble.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Evidence of drainage pipes have been discovered in homes of the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China they also had baths. In Roman civilization, the bathroom was sometimes a part of a public bath where men and women used the same bath.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, it means you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects the message back to it.
The satellite was launched by rocket, scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It uses a large rocket to lift a satellite or telescope to a height of 100 feet in space.
The wheel has transformed the world in amazing ways, and the biggest thing it has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
It allowed us to buy trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are larger medium-sized predators that hunt everything from deer to medium-sized prey.
Lastly, there are many small cats here (including small domestic cats) that prey on smaller animals such as mice, frogs, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success lies in the concept of hierarchy. A certain status that an individual holds that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are very social cats that live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related males, as well as more than thirty females and young males.
Women are generally closely related to each other through a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion groups behave like wolf packs, and the animals are remarkably lion-like in behavior (although not as big as a big cat), and are often deadly to their prey.
An all-round athlete, Tiger can climb (though not well), dive, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The cheetah is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. They are the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as loud as that of a lion, but it is still almost like a roar, or a cry.
Ocelots prefer small prey such as rodents, snakes, fish, and birds. All of the animals that the ocelot preys on are usually smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that Ocelots track and locate prey on the ground by using their sense of smell, and they hunt and roam their territories.
These creatures have night vision and can move quietly. Oscillots can see their surroundings to find prey and then capture their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as they go to a mountain or river or they are then moved to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from the first.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so a new population will need to develop different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they originally needed to be.
The native population has not changed much, but they still require the same adjustments as before.
As time goes by, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they become less visible and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, two species will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We refer to this process as speciation, meaning the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important aspect of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and they consume carbon dioxide which humans exhale (as they breathe out).
Plants obtain their nutrition from the sun through photosynthesis. They provide shade.
We make our homes with plants, and we make our clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is from plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the greatest hunter of its time and was not afraid of anyone except for other Mosasaurs.
Its large jaw is filled with over 70 razor sharp teeth, and even more teeth in the upper jaw of its mouth, meaning that it is hard for anything to escape that comes in its path.
We don’t know for sure, but it could have had a language of its own. Its prey includes cuttlefish, large fish, and other aquatic animals, and it could have been a man-eater.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. rex could not compete with it.
While most of their diet may be familiar to us, the Romans had their own exotic or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snake, and a type of dormouse called the glis glis.
Another difference was that while poor people and women would eat sitting on chairs, wealthy people preferred to recline and eat comfortably in their surroundings.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that were brought from Asia or the Americas in previous centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never even tasted turkey!
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the deity.
People would bring offerings to the gods and priests would try to fulfill the wishes of the gods through ceremonies and rituals.
Every temple has an outer temple courtyard and then an inner sanctum which can only be entered by the priests.
Sometimes special minaret-like towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the worship area.
The tower's top is a special sanctuary for God.
In the hot weather of the Middle East, home was not so important.
The Hebrew family spent much of their life in the wilderness.
Women cooked in the courtyard; stores were open and facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, while traveling further west, he discovered a green land and named it Greenland.
But even before this discovery, the Eskimo tribes had already been living here for some time.
Although each country is Scandinavian, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have many differences in their people, kings, customs and history.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might have noticed that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although the document has some writing on it, it is not a treasure map.
The phrase "July 4, 1776 were the original words of freedom" is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is situated at the bottom of the document, in an upside-down orientation.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is said that in its early life, large parchment documents (its size ranges from 29¾ inches to 24½ inches) were rolled up for storage.
Thus, there is a possibility that this marker has only been added as a label.
The D-Day landings and following battles had freed the north of France, but the south remained under occupation.
It was governed by the "watchful" French. These French men had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting against them.
On August 15th, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was known as "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The term civilization is derived from the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, which comes from the Latin civitas, meaning city or city-state, and refers to the measure of a society's social development.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture, a long cultural footprint, and equitable distribution are employed for the transmission of knowledge across many generations.
Many small cultures disappear without leaving any traceable historical evidence, and fail to retain their identity as a distinct civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, under the Articles of Confederation, the Thirteen States initially formed a weak central government. Congress was the only federal authority.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes and, as there was no national executive or judiciary to enforce its actions, it had to rely on state authorities, who were often uncooperative.
It did not have the power to abolish tax laws and duties between states.
The amendment could only be made if there was unanimous consent from all the states and the states had so undermined the central government that many of their representatives were absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Italians competing in international games and Olympic events are very popular in the northern regions of the country.
Japan has over 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that make up Japan, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago," based on its geographical position.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors crossing the island recorded it as Ilha da Moça, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in traditional grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers for their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it recognized Japanese rule over Taiwan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Windowed Room.
Many of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to help visitors discover what they looked like in the past.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For instance, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size during the era of analog film.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its design has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format (obtained by dividing it by twelve to produce the ratio of a simple integer) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or approximately close to this aspect ratio.
The most insulting and disrespectful rule of thumb is a simple instruction that establishes the principles of motion while maintaining the size of the sequence in an image.
This rule states that the most effective place for the subject is at the intersection of lines where the image is divided into three parts by vertical and horizontal lines (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, for more than a thousand years Christianity has united European states.
He has had an impact on everyone from the king to the common man.
One Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate sickness and poverty, and the financial resources of the church are specifically intended for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church in Rome has existed for over a thousand years, and this focus on power and money has raised questions in many minds as to whether the rule was being fulfilled or not.
Shortly after the start of the conflict, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of targeting key military and civilian leaders has proven effective, even though this tactic usually violates international law as set forth by numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has established an international waterway to prevent any vessel from entering the entire sea, which also poses a threat to neutral ships.
While there was a limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and individualism.
After witnessing the fear and horror of war during the First World War, nations expressed a desire to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each phase or dynasty that was in power represented a specific imperial family.
But in every royal family there is a volatile period where the provinces are divided. The best-known of these times is the Three Kingdoms period and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During this period, there was a fierce struggle for the throne among several emperors.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the most violent periods in ancient Chinese history where thousands of people died in battles for the highest seat in the great imperial palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences such as the use of the metric system, the transition from non-democracy to democracy, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to any one ruler.
After the revolutionary occupations, all men's applications were also accepted, providing the greatest potential and the highest chance for success.
The same is true for the military, as those who were previously under the military's ranking class are now under its caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He went to meditate in a cave known as "Hira" which is located on the mountains of "Noor" (light).
He kept himself in a cave that survived for a long time, giving a clear picture of the spiritual aspects of Muhammad.
The cave, located on a mountain peak north of Mecca, is isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if everyone knew it existed. Inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
The clear, beautiful sky and many mountains around can be seen from inside the cave. Inside the cave, a small part of this world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
In the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, the Giza Plateau or the "Ancient Cemetery of Giza", which includes several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid of Egypt was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and shrines were built for his wife and family.
A "high comma" makes a V shape, and a "low comma" makes a macron or a half square shape.
The top means you should start from the tip and press down, and the bottom means you should start from the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and tap the button.
An over-whisper usually produces a soft sound, while a down-whisper is stronger and more forceful.
Do not hesitate to write your markings in pencil, but remember that printed music markings are there for a reason, so they should generally be respected.
The alarmed King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged four), and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
In a freight car, they traveled back to Paris, joining a crowd of people shouting threats and intimidations against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
At one point, a member of the crowd hung the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of the U.S. imperial war in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
A large part of the U.S. colonial government's spending and interest on bonds flowed through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government and they were forced to pay taxes.
Indeed, the increased profits that Filipinos obtained from greater unpaid labor would be a fundamental benefit to the U.S. empire.
To understand the Templars, one must comprehend the concept that created the Order.
This period, which began around the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries AD 1000-1300, is commonly known as the High Middle Ages in European history.
The High Middle Ages is preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas, from the practical application of technology-push or technology-led thinking to the bounded awareness that human destiny is driven by the fundamental logic and laws associated with science and technology in their various manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological consequences share two general ideas: that technological advances are beyond cultural or political constraints and that technologies result in "impacts" on societies that are inherited rather than social conditions.
For example, one could argue that the motor car was essential to the development of roads.
However, for multi-car fleets, a nationwide road network is not economically viable, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Excessive car use also causes high rates of road accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism is a major element of cultural heritage, as written by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, individuals with specific geographical backgrounds developed customs and culture associated with that geography over time and as these were adapted to the society's norms, they were considered superior to arbitrarily enforced laws.
In the same way that Paris is considered the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The reputation of being a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, whose prices were higher than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
This was the time when the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height between the 10th - 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was largely influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can be traced back 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. Crusaders started using buttons to fasten their clothing, which resulted in great advancement during that time.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that increases yield by using leftover seeds from crop rotation or other related methods in the same ecoregion.
Historically, many farmers were engaged in food agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures gather like-minded individuals who feel that they have been ignored by societal norms and provide them with a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ based on age, race, social class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that differentiate a subculture might be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of practices.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and sayings.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of sociology is to focus on some of the unfortunate events involving children who were neglected, abused or mistreated in an intentional way, becoming unsocialized by adults as they were growing up.
These types of children are referred to as "feral" or "wild." Some feral children are confined by people (usually their parents). In some cases, children are abandoned due to their parents' inability to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
The violence may have occurred before children were abandoned or fled, or after they were subjected to child abuse or physical violence.
It is said that the Kafi were raised by animals, while some were left to fend for themselves in the wild.
When raised as non-human animals, feral pups will behave entirely like a wild animal (within physical limits), as they are fearful and aloof from humans.
While project-based learning can make learning easier and more enjoyable, scaffolding takes it one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support that helps people who are undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of the scaffold but is also the miniature paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated within the software and are meant to ask questions, point out, and explain methods that a student might have difficulty understanding on their own.
Due to a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, to abuse, to bullying, children are placed in foster care.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that lacks nurturing, education and support, but they do.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is about providing safe homes, loving caregivers, sustainable education, and trustworthy healthcare.
Foster care should provide all the necessities that were not present in the home where the child was previously living.
The Internet connects elements of mass and interconnectedness.
The various features of the internet lead to greater diffusion in terms of usage and convenient access.
For example, scientific and sociological have been proposed as key motivators for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Egme and Maccard identified "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" as new motivational factors when they tested the reactions of participants on the website.
Video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions, it is possible to determine if someone is lying or not.
In his article 'The President's Speech', Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain disorders are nevertheless able to accurately assess the truth.
In fact, it suggests that animals such as domestic dogs may lack the ability to interpret human behavior.
19th-century research has shown that there are two poles of genetic variation: hidden and visible.
Sex change involves new genetic mutations, and selection eliminates these changes from the pool of mutations that are visible.
With each generation, separation or recombination between the two poles moves the change back and forth.
Outside of the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty meeting their amino acid requirements from plant sources.
However, failure to do so has dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible sources of protein from plants are found in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (chicken, duck, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all things, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some similar way to how savannah chimps do today.
Sleep cycling is the process of waking up frequently during your normal sleep period and falling back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
It can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you see your alarm clock reset when you are sleeping, it may be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-based options include drinking the most liquid items first (especially water or tea, a known urine booster) while sleeping, and forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in his body and soul.
The less anxiety, the more life force is released. Everyone has the ability to achieve complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle in the way of that aim is our own restlessness and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddhism, but has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and the profound art of Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It involves Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of deep-felt love.
Kundalini energy (mythical energy) is awakened through Kundalini yoga which involves yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization techniques.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of the enlightened self is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy that brought about collaboration between the USSR and the United States. As the war ended, the differences between the countries' systems, practices, and culture began to decrease.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the real fight would be fought through proxy armies in places from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup alongside the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost thwarted overnight, after the Soviet Union invaded Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, when the Soviet Union entered 800,000 troops from the Red Army and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
The Navy's traditional role has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and supplies, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same when they move their own people and supplies.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, particularly using U-boats, was trying to block this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have succeeded in conquering Britain, just as it had the rest of Europe.
10,000 years ago, goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran for home use.
Ancient cultures and tribes started to provide them with easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are usually kept in paddocks or other grazing areas where they are free to roam. They are often supervised by herders, who are often children or young people, and are more commonly known as shepherds. These grazing practices have been used for a long time.
Wagonways were built in Britain in the early 16th century.
Although wagonways only consisted of parallel wooden planks, these allowed horses to approach them so they had to adopt faster speeds and pull greater loads than the still-worse roads of the day.
Crosses were introduced early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was later realized that if the tracks had an iron bar on top, they would be more efficient.
It became the norm to have more mud on the wagon wheel, causing even more mud to stick to the wagon wheel.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway carriages were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the arrival of Homo erectus, meaning upright man.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not move in a straight line according to their habits.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, while Orrorin tugenensis walked on two legs around six million years ago.
We can live harmoniously with the environment, participate in the environmental movement, and even actively work to reduce future harm to some extent.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many diseases. If we don't want just temporary solutions, we need to find the root cause of the problems, and we need to deactivate them.
It is evident that the scientific and technological advancements of humanity have brought about many changes in the world, and the problems have increased due to the growing population and the luxurious lifestyle of humankind.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a signed draft handwritten by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to Dunlap's printing shop.
150 to 200 copies were made overnight, which were called "Dunlop Broadsides."
The document was first read publicly on July 8th by John Nixon at the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlop Broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. No original handwritten copy has survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be like dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still many things about these birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with claws and toes, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may become apparent immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term "big cat" is used by experts in the field of wildlife in a formal sense for this group of cat species.
The term comes from ancient knowledge of the beatings that empower humans to endure pain.
Both the Assin-bug and the bed-bug are parasites, residing in the living quarters or attics of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which remains a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or for the adoption of a child, not in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose to adopt children if they have planned for it.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary purpose of science is to discover how the world functions through scientific methods. In reality, the scientific method guides most scientific research.
An experiment isn't just a test, but a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers studied ancient texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all branches of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific foundations.
Many waves found in physiology and behavior are largely reliant on the presence of basal currents and their production by biological clocks.
Sequential mutations, which are not simply responses to external sequential cues, have been documented for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycling period even in the absence of external cues.
One of the key concepts from the Hershey and Chase experiment was that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, either by marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or by marking the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutation can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected organisms are brood parasites or not.
The mutation can only be passed onto the offspring in breeding mammals, while in other places the mutation can cause death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts individuals interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and touring parks and learning about ecosystems.
An example is visiting Borneo to see, take photos, and learn about the orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to their workplaces and pass by other places, which are their work destinations that they just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is connected in some way, and to a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this high-carbon economy has disturbed the ecosystem from its stable state that has sustained human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, one occasionally hears complaints about water quality or bridges deteriorating to the same extent.
Why do transportation systems encounter so many complaints, failing on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because one cannot predict the behavior of a driver with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave to a reasonable extent. This results in a reasonable consistency in traffic flow that can be expressed in figures with a slightly higher difference.
To better illustrate traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and implementation of roadway facilities.
Geese were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many worms have the advantage of being able to attach their wings to their bodies.
This allows them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are Dragonflies and Mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought this to be true, but many thought otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and many other stars as well).
This seems reasonable because it doesn't appear that the Earth is spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching up to six miles wide.
20 percent of all the freshwater that drains into the world's oceans comes from the Amazon river basin.
The central Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although the stone choupal-houses continued to exist into the Old Kingdom, the choupal-houses of Gaza were never surpassed in their size and architectural magnificence.
The New Kingdom Ancient Egyptians were amazed to discover the tombs of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian language in its legislation and official documents.
Italian is also an everyday language that is mostly used by those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The Vatican City is entirely Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything was made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
There are four types of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it is also theorized that some of what we see could be transformed into other matter.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, silver and gold are also metals.
These metal compounds may also contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, this pencil became a friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing emerge, the pencil is becoming less important and less used.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to touch the physical template.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's like climbing a steep mountain with a heavy rock. The center is broken again, releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can break apart easily with or without a trigger.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and soil. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The surface layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
The sides may be more exposed because of the snow-covered crust. It is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what makes people trust or believe.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories shed light on things that concern people, the things they want to do, and the things in their environment that compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of materials are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two attitudes can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to be "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is an unidentifiable person who feels like they want to change everything and do it their way, which the team is doing.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often creates tension between the leader and the other members of the team.
Real teams are held to the same high standards as ordinary teams, with slight differences.
Actual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate peer group.
They are often more autonomous than traditional team members because their teams may be located in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larsen and LaFascio, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to undertake the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and artistry can flourish when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the coordinated effort by the enterprise to remove barriers can lead to a new innovation process to better meet the needs of the user.
Before an organization can become innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation and foster shared knowledge of organizational learning.
Engel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides empirical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition. As a result, it shortens the research process and makes it more precise.
The connection between neuropathology and behavior provides scientists with assistance in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and traumas can affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and previously unseen processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to construct visual models that help us understand the workings of our brain.
While AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and cognitive changes in a machine.
Research in AI involves developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer's questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These types of things have become separate fields, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been integrated into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a significant part of any classroom. Often, a teacher prefers to take their students to a place where there is no option of traveling by bus.
Technology provides a solution with virtual field trips. Students can sit in their classroom and view ancient artifacts in museums, tour fish houses, or admire beautiful artwork.
Apparently, participating in a field trip is a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For instance, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol; the website is refreshed every year, but previous versions are kept online as a type of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually helps them improve.
When students are frequently critical attendees, the blogger begins to try to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy audience interest inspires students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond the typical traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs empowers students to be analysts and critics. By actively responding to Internet content, students can determine their own position in the context of others' writing and also outline their own views on specific issues (Orwake, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's bustling, bilingual capital and is home to a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and north of it is Muskoka, home to endless natural beauty.
All these things, and Ontario more prominently, are what outsiders tend to think of as purely Canadian.
The larger northern areas are less populated, and some are completely deserted.
A fact that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
In terms of wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and most diverse island.
Many of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahara and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that a woman should reveal her original marital status, by stating if she is married or not.
A beard is also helpful (not just the one that looks the most expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as abuse and that following through, shaking hands, etc. is not unusual.
Be firm in dealing with people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber merchants in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese dismantled it and renamed it Casa Branca, only leaving it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida and named it Casablanca by the Italian merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan crafts around the old medina, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, rugs, and the whole spectacle of the souks, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trip to the outskirts of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the conflict in the North Kivu province.
The town of Nyiragongo also serves as a base for volcanic mountaineering and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
In Goma, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around. The typical local cost for a ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but despite its reputation, it remains a popular tourist destination and even has an airport.
In 1990, due to the threat of desertification, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
This was one of the major challenges during the PBS special of Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as its style is more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is situated in the north-eastern part of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park spans 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting wildlife.
It is the most popular attraction in South Africa and is considered one of the most beautiful of the South African National Parks (SAN Parks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee.
Obtaining a Wild Card may be beneficial as it allows entry into selected parks in South Africa or into selected national parks throughout the country.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists pay special attention to.
The arrangement of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline is shown by a shiny bar chart that represents the presence of water in Victoria Harbor.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite side of the Kowloon Waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the densely populated northern coast.
This is the area where the British settlers first settled and if you are looking for evidence of past settlers in this area, this is the best place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest that stretches 80 kilometers (50 miles) along the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian mainland is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the jungles are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain remnants of the great jungles that once covered some of the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about three quarters is water/marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river), most of which, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Mantang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses within the district are often crowded, it is recommended to buy tickets several days in advance.
In many districts, small Japanese coaster buses are running, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint Georges d'Oiapoque in French Guiana, spanning the Oiapoque River.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, 378 meters long, and 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is set to fully open for use in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, they lived as partly nomadic hunters who also did the necessary agricultural work.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Paiaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", was formed as a result of the Spanish conquerors' conflicts with local indigenous groups.
The Andalusians began a period of neo-colonialism that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has been successful in retaining much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is widely known for having one of the best polo teams in the world and for having some of the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Los Cañitos.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can be found here.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
The FIC West store is the only bank on the island where money can be exchanged, and that bank is located in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are not widely accepted on the outer islands, although UK and US currency is accepted; check with the owners first about what type of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so you should exchange it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in the southern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate. During the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can get cold with snow: temperatures sometimes drop below freezing, and combined air and humidity can feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "wet" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from deer and donkeys and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how friendly they may seem, moose, bison, American bison, elk, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Every year, thousands of tourists are injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's best to keep away from them.
Additionally, be aware that the scent attracts deer and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the seat of Samoa's government since 1959.
In 1889, the harbor was the site of a notorious naval riot when ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for liberation organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of the paramilitary group Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to the extended coastline between its two harbors. The most popular ones are the three-part beaches.
The North Shore beaches (North Harbor District) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
With safe swimming, these are mostly sandy beaches, and many have shade provided by the Poitokawa trees.
The Smoky Drive beaches are located in the central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helier's upmarket wharves on the Whitimbe Harbour.
These are sometimes beaches filled with families as well as various shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
Mikiya is the local beer 'number one', it is not a complicated beer, but is tasty and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Many people enjoy French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be even more popular.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easily available.
A 'flat white' coffee is considered for Australians. It is a small 'espresso' topped with cappuccino cream (not foam) and served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality and the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and one of the reasons it's so crowded is because it is hit by so many travelers.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found near the coast and north of 1770 from October to April. They may be found outside of these times by chance.
Sharks are present, though they infrequently attack humans. Many sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea by drifting, their main habitat is in the river north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels. However, it may be possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents often put together packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight and hotel deals.
If you need some time to think about the offer or to obtain some other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can also reserve a room for you.
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider it to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get up early in the morning and head to a campsite near the music.
Remember that while music on the main stage may have finished, there may still be music playing in some sections of the festival late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in winter, make sure to put on a jumpsuit, as crossing the ice often creates a very frightening sound for those affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (be sure to check conditions).
Casinos generally make every effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and finding the exit can be difficult.
To keep guests in a good mood and to maintain that mood, offer them good food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some venues serve alcohol on the premises. However, being drunk can impair one's judgement, and all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The car is slow on snow-covered and icy roads, and you cannot drive as you would on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, there can be enough snow to trap you on the road in a very short time.
Visibility can be restricted by snow that is falling or blowing, or by snow accumulating on the windows of a vehicle.
On the other hand, in many countries, snow-covered and snowy conditions are common, with traffic running largely uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for tourists.
The popular term for a land journey to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah, is safari.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come very close to cars and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "going for a walk") consists of hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 14th to September 5th, 2021. Several events will be held in various locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 prior to the announcement of postponement, your situation may be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but most cancellations related to coronavirus by the end of March will not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is hoped that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing ¥7,000.
Ironing washed clothes can help with drying. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available upon request even if they are not available in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't have socks that need ironing, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Do not allow the cloth to become too hot (it may dry out, or in some cases, slightly burn).
There are several methods to purify water, some are more effective than others in mitigating specific risks.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other areas several minutes are required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may have to deal with animal pests because they are not familiar with them in their home regions.
Ticks can cause harm, create itching, or in a worst-case scenario, be the cause of an allergic reaction, spread poison or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with force, generally do not occur in epidemics.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in some locations.
Travelers to high tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo Petersburg Highway presents challenging driving conditions, as it passes through a separate wild trail.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, think about the following: high speeds, narrow lanes, and fast curves.
The posted speed limits are visibly lower than those of the preceding and following sections—usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and strict compliance is even more necessary in these cases.
Surprisingly, however, mobile phone service here is stronger than in many other rural areas, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, neighboring its southern neighbor Austria, they are very rich and come in many varieties.
Fruit pastries are common, soap-baked pastries are available year-round, and cherry and potato stews appear during the summer.
Many German dishes include almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often served with a cup of hot coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the regionally named Berliner, Fencochene, Rijpfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
A mixture can become "dry" or "juicy" depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, it is common to use ghee in cooking while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut oil is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is diverse blending regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used in addition to more passing, the word may mean a food originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers the best taste with the help of only simple seasonal dishes, Javanese dishes, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The strap helps the rider who is on either side of the saddle.
These stirrups provide maximum safety for the rider, but there may be safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has their foot caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
Initially, the horseman would wear riding boots with a spur and a very smooth, straight edge.
After that, some paddles, especially English paddles, have safety bars that help the rider escape from the paddle if the falling rider pulls them back.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's most popular climbing destination, known for its varied granite high walls and cliffs, is known as the Yosemite of South America.
These peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world make their way up the mountain on routes between the unbreakable walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities that involve sliding on a snow-covered slope or by attaching a snowboard to one's feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity, with many enthusiasts, commonly referred to as "ski bums", planning entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is much older--dating back to 5000 BC with cave carvings found in Scaeira.
